## About
The Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) digital service is split into a number of different microservices all serving specific functions which are listed below:

**Liability tool** - Standalone frontend service that is used to check a company's liability in regards to the levy.

**Frontend** - The main frontend for the service which includes the pages for registration.

**Backend** - The service that the frontend uses to call HOD APIs to retrieve and send information relating to business information and subscribing to the levy.

**Stub** - Microservice that is used to mimic the DES APIs when running services locally or in the development and staging environments.

This is the main frontend, currently containing the registration form.
